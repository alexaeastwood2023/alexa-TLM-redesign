     On all the pages I got the information and the wording about TLM on the TLMBrandguide2022 that was given for me to use.
     Alysha Eppard helped me with the background color of my "hamburger" on my home page so that when it was in mobile size you could actually see that it was a button.
     Melissa Schultheis helped me with the README and the text shadow as well as giving me an idea of what my logo should look like. She also helped me re-word the information I got off the TLM brochure.
     Megan Mecum helped me with the font awesome images. 
     Phaedra Winters gave me advise on to text center the media channels. 
     Katherine Holmes also encouraged me to add more images in as well.
